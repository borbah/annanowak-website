            <p>Shortly after the Civil War ended in Sri Lanka Anna felt moved to somehow contribute to those communities whose life circumstances had been affected by the conflict. In 2010 she volunteered for the Foundation of Goodness in Sri Lanka, where she designed and led her own project, working with children and families who had suffered during both the civil war and devastating tsunami. </p>

            <p>It was an invaluable experience to witness the kindness among the communities, the love they have for their land and the humble appreciation for whatever life brings. Coming back to the UK Anna realized that if she wanted to work with underprivileged communities in the future she needed to acquire knowledge and understanding of a variety of disciplines. She began her studies of Environment at the Open University in 2011 and continued with the study of International Development and Geographies of Globalization.

            <p>Since then Anna accomplished several solo journeys in pursuit of first-hand knowledge of the community lives in many countries. In 2011 she spent 5 weeks in Brazil, observing two community conservation projects and in 2013 she worked with children from the Anidan Shelter House in Kenya. In 2012 she lead two choreographic residencies in Bejing, connected with the Olympic Games in London (under the umbrella of CWM) and during her time there she investigated the culture and a forgotten village in a rural parts of China with invaluable help of her guide and inerpreteur Sophie Miu Zhu.  In 2017 she spent a month in South Africa as one of two European artists invited to work on a dance & creativity project with disadvantaged youth.

            <p>Anna continues to explore the role of Arts & creativity cross-culturally in the globalised world, nourishing her passion for exploring, travelling and finding ways to create value in a contemporary world.</p>
