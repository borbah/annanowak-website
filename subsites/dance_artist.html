            <p>Anna perceives movement as an integral part of her life, which is transcending and informing each and every experience of the ‘dance of life’ like an imprint.
                Working with ones own body and mind, being constantly exposed to the physical and intellectual challenge that it demands creates a unique kind of fulfillment. The act of embodying the movement, being present in ones own body and overcoming the limitations of the mind whilst investing fully in the awareness of the present moment is a truly enriching act.</p>

            <p>When Anna experienced the feeling and the process of working on a contemporary choreography for the first time, she never looked back. This was during the creation of “Few Short Sequences’ by Jacek Przybylowicz (Warsaw, 2005). This newly discovered freedom and sense of authenticity has informed her dancing as well as her interests as a Dance Artist. Deepening her resolve to work creatively, be intellectually challenged and perform the kind of work, which allows a sense of exploration and risk she left PNB and started her international career. Initially moving to Spain, she then found her way to London, where she is based since January 2008. Anna is now making her own work and she loves working on the other side of the curtain and watching the piece come together. </p>
