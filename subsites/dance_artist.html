            <p>Anna Nowak danced with the Company Wayne McGregor between 2008-2016. She took part in all of the Company’s creations, participated in numerous films, art installations and a variety of projects, which gave her an unparalleled opportunity for autonomous creativity at the highest level and an invaluable diversity of experience in her professional development. Before joining CWM she danced in the classically oriented Polish National Ballet and the smaller young neoclassical and contemporary Gran Canaria Ballet. After 16 years of professional dancing and touring internationally, she felt ready to move on to exploring different roles in the art of dance.</p>

            <p>The mission of working with ones own body and mind with the physical and intellectual challenge that it demands has an incredible power to create a unique kind of fulfillment. The simple act of embodying the movement, being present in ones own body and overcoming the limitations of the mind whilst investing fully in the awareness of the present moment is a truly enriching act.</p>

   It wasn’t until the creation of ‘Few Short Sentences’ by Jacek Przybylowicz that she experienced the joy and freedom coming from being part of the creative process, the making of a contemporary piece. This newly discovered freedom and sense of authenticity has informed her dancing as well as her interests as a Dance Artist.

She performed solo roles in all of Jacek Przybylowicz works, deepening her resolve to work creatively, be intellectually challenged and perform the kind of work which allows a sense of exploration and risk. In 2007 she left the National Ballet and moved to Spain to join the Gran Canaria Ballet, where she danced the principal role in Uwe Sholtz’s “Jeunehomme’. Unfortunately the company was forced to close and she moved to Madrid to start working with the Victor Ullate Company. Several weeks later, she was invited to audition for Random Dance in London and from the first hour in the studio with Wayne she knew that she has found her place. She moved to London and started working with Wayne McGregor in January 2008. She feels grateful for her long and rich career with CWM and the fulfillment it brought from performing works she truly believed in and which allowed her to expand intellectually and creatively.

                Anna has performed in the most prestigious venues in the world, including the USA, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Asia and most European countries. She was part of the creation of ‘Entity’, ‘Dyad 1909’, ‘FAR’, ‘Undance’, and ‘Atomos’ and danced in several other productions. She was part of the Rain Room installation shown at the Barbican Centre in London and the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. She performed Work in Process at the Guggenheim Museum Theatre in New York and at the New York Fashion Week VIP event. Anna has re-staged Wayne McGregor’s FAR excerpts in London and in Berlin. She loves working on the other side of the curtain and watching the piece come together. -->
