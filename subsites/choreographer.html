            <p>Where is it coming from, this need to make something out of nothing? How is the process of creation
                forcing its way through our senses and receptors? How does our perception transmit information from the
                outside world into the inner world before emerging back into form?</p>

            <p>During creative process Anna explores questions she feels presented with and manifests them on a physical
                plane when the need to dress up the indescribable becomes an imperative.</p>
            <p>Finding what feels like the right expression of the right subject in the right moment in time is what
                makes her fascination with choreography alive and filled with curiosity. A certain kind of satisfaction
                is to be found when things come together into completeness, when creativity playing with form is allowed
                to make its own choices, finding its own aesthetic. Then agreeing with the form, which emerges from the
                process, becomes a simple act of connecting the unknown with obvious.  </p>
