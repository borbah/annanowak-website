            <p>After Anna’s fruitful career as a professional dancer her passion for creating took her back to the studio in order to choreograph. Magic happens during the creative process:  something appears out of nothing, ideas crash and evolve, and problem solving at the highest level is demanded. Creation IS playing with form in the most tangible way – for Anna this is the space where choreography comes to life. Movement is everywhere, it has always been and always will be part of our lives and as such can serve as the ultimate form of expression. </p>
